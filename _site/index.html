				I go by Mads. I have a BS in Computer Science from the University of Oregon <sup> sco ducks
				</sup>. In an effort to keep up my skills as dev/engineer I have decided to make this ongoing
				project to help me keep my skills sharp.

			<p>
				I'm really over my job hunt. I've been looking for work since 2023. I am a barista for the 
				time being <sub> (hopefully) </sub> and I am really tired of applying.
				<br>
				Ask me about coffee! I love to talk about it <sub> (and drink it) </sub>.
			</p>
			<p> 
				In the meantime, I'm going to spend an ungodly amount of time working on this.
				<br>
				<br>
				I also like to look at trends, whether it's Pinterest or global trade. I'm not picky.
