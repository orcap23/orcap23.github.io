			Hi, name is Maddie Porcaro. I go by Mads. I have a BS in Computer Science from the University in 
			In an effort to keep up my skills as dev/engineer I have decided to make this ongoing
			project to help me keep my skills sharp.
		
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm really over my job hunt. I've been looking for work since 2023. I am a barista for the 
			time being <sub> (hopefully) </sub> and I am really tired of applying.
			<br>
			Ask me about coffee! I love to talk about it <sub> (and drink it) </sub>.
		</p>
		<p> In the meantime, I'm going to spend an ungodly amount of time working on this.
			<br>
			<br>
			I also like to look at trends, whether it's Pinterest or global trade. I'm not picky.
